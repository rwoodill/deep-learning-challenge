## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. 
With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:
### Data Preprocessing

- What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
    - The target variable is the "y" ("IS_SUCCESSSFUL" column).
- What variable(s) are the features for your model?
    - The features are "X" (all other columns included in dataset, i.e. "NAME", "APPLICATION_TYPE", "AFFILIATION", "CLASSIFICATION", "USE_CASE", "ORGANIZATION", "STATUS", "INCOME_AMT", "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS", "ASK_AMT").
- What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
    - The columns "EIN" and "NAME" were removed as they are neither targets nor features.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
    - Initially the configuration was as follows:
        - 1st layer - 80, "relu"
        - 2nd layer - 30, "sigmoid"
        - Output layer - 1, "sigmoid"
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
    -  Yes, on the fourth try I was able to bring the accuracy to 0.783
- What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
    - Attempt One: I added another hidden layer and changed activation type
    - Attempt Two: I raised the number of epochs
    - Attempt Three: I increased the number of neurons per layer
    - Attempt Four: I changed the preprocessing of the data. Essentially, instead of simply removing the "NAME" column, I removed any "NAME" that appeared less than 10 times. Other values such as number of layers and neurons remained the same as the initial optimization attempt (Attempt One)

## Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.

Overall, the model was able to achieve an accuracy of 78%. This means it will correctly classify the data 78% of the time. 

### Alternative Method

This model worked relatively well and provided close to 80% accuracy. 

However, an alternative approach could be to use the random forest model. This algorithim generates a "forest" of decision trees, combining them to produce more accurate predictions. The random forest model is well suited for classification purposes, so would be a good alternative.
